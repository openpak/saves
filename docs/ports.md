# Ports — saves (trimmed)

One block per concern, nothing below 20000, nothing at or above 27000 (Photon-Reference and
Steam live there). Every service reads its listeners from `<SVC>_HTTP_ADDR`, `<SVC>_GRPC_ADDR`,
`<SVC>_METRICS_ADDR`; the values below are the defaults and the local-run convention. Each
service owns a block of ten: +0 HTTP, +1 gRPC, +2 metrics/pprof, +3..+9 spare.

## 20020 block

| Block | Service | HTTP | gRPC | metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20020 | `saves` | 20020 | 20021 | 20022 |

Other services' rows live in the canonical ports.md.
